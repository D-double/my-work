# MY WORK

This project was created to train students on Bootstrap v5.0.1. During my studies I taught:
+ downloading custom fonts,
+ using css variables,
+ naming classes according to the BEM methodology,
+ animation creation,
+ design changes for dark and light operating system themes,
+ columnar layout and adaptation to different browser screens using bootstrap classes,
+ adding and changing bootstrap components (Navbar, Carousel, Accordion, Tabs).
